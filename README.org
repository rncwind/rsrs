* RuSt Reverse Shell
** What is this?
A reverse shell generator written in rust.
** Why?
I enjoy playing CTFs. There are reverse shell generators available on the web,
but i wanted a single binary program that I could throw into containers and VMs
easily, or just netcat across the wire to a target box.
